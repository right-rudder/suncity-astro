I am working on getting my instrument rating and the Sun City team has been wonderful. My Flight Instructor Jean is great. I feel like I’m becoming a better pilot after each lesson. The planes are in great shape and I feel safe flying them (especially flying XC). Overall 5 Stars!",

They take the time to explain everything clearly, so you never feel lost. The planes are in great shape, and you always feel safe and comfortable when you’re up in the air. What I love most is the friendly and supportive vibe—everyone there is rooting for you. Whether you're just starting out or looking to level up your skills, Sun City Aviation is the place to be. Highly recommend!",

I was referred to Sun City from a DPE (FAA Designated Pilot Examiner) after I had a bad experience with a flight school in Melbourne FL. If one of the most well-known DPEs in the South Florida area recommended it (out of many), it carried a lot of weight given this is what they do day in and day out. They know where the best instructors are, the most well-maintained airplanes, and best pass rates for checkrides. The recommendation did not disappoint.",

Getting to the finish line for my PPL would not have happened without Georgette and Luke, the owners. They are like a second set of parents to me after this rating. They are by far the most family oriented flight school I have been apart of and if you give them the chance, they will treat you like their family.",
