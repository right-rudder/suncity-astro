We're bursting with pride! Our very own **Cara Ming** has been recognized by the **AOPA Foundation** as a **Distinguished Flight Instructor for 2025**. This prestigious award is a testament to Cara's unwavering dedication, exceptional teaching skills, and the genuine passion she brings to our flight school every single day.

Since joining **Sun City Aviation Academy** just over a year ago, Cara has quickly become an invaluable member of our team. Her ability to connect with students, break down complex concepts, and instill confidence in aspiring pilots is truly remarkable. We constantly hear from students about how Cara's guidance has not only helped them master the technical aspects of flying but also ignited a lifelong love for aviation.

**Cara**'s commitment to excellence extends beyond the cockpit. She's a constant source of support and encouragement, always willing to go the extra mile to help her students achieve their dreams. Her enthusiasm is contagious, and her positive attitude creates a learning environment where students thrive.
