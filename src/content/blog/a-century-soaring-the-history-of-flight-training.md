Happy New Year from the team at Sun City Aviation Academy!

We’re excited to roll into 2024 with the momentum we achieved in the year before. With a new year come new aircraft, new students, and new graduates; we sincerely hope you can become a part of our family. Before looking forward to 2024 though, we felt that it would be interesting to kick the year off with a look back at how the flight training industry has evolved.

Spanning the last 115 years, the aviation landscape has come a long way, transcending its humble origins with the Wright Brothers. This evolution traverses a spectrum of roles within the expansive realm of the aviation industry, marking not just the invention of the airplane but the establishment of structured aviation education at one of the earliest flight schools globally.

It All Started With the Wright Brothers...

The story of flight began with the Wright Brothers: visionaries who pioneered the invention of the airplane and laid the foundation for structured aviation education. Their establishment of one of the inaugural flight schools in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1910 marked the genesis of the flight school legacy. This institution, finding its home at Maxwell Air Force Base, evolved into a crucible for aviators. Notable figures like Hap Arnold and Thomas DeWitt Milling emerged from here, marking the pioneering era of aviation. World War I then brought an intensified demand for trained pilots, leading to the establishment of multiple flight schools across the U.S., with the Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP) of 1939 playing a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of aviation education.

Post-WWI, pilot training underwent some profound transformations. Milestones such as the inception of aeronautical engineering programs at renowned institutions like MIT in 1926 and the University of Michigan (during the war) signified pivotal moments in this era. Numerous flight schools emerged across the U.S., each contributing to the consistent growth and diversification of the sector. The cost of obtaining a Private Pilot Certificate reflected the intricate interplay with the changing economy too. Demographics and diversity among student pilots became more vibrant, illustrating the growing appeal and accessibility of aviation education. This inclusivity mirrors the community spirit inherent in the aviation field today.

## Famous Aviators: Icons in the Skies

No summary of aviation history would be complete without acknowledging the iconic aviators who left their enduring mark on flight training. Orville Wright, after establishing the Montgomery Flight School became an instructor and directly contributed to the early days of flight training. Amelia Earhart, a trailblazer for women in aviation, became the first female aviator to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1932, inspiring generations with her courage and determination. Chuck Yeager, breaking the sound barrier in 1947, exemplified the daring spirit pushing the boundaries of flight. Their extraordinary feats and contributions both advanced the field and served as inspiration for aspiring aviators worldwide.
