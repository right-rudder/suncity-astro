### Putting Safety Above Everything Else

Flying is an amazing experience. Seeing the beaches of **Hollywood** and **Miami** from above is something you will never forget. But before we ever leave the ground, there is one thing that matters more than anything else: **safety**.

At **Sun City Aviation Academy**, we believe that a good pilot is a safe pilot. Whether you are flying for fun or training for a career, following high safety standards is the key to success. Here is how we make sure every flight at **North Perry Airport** is a safe one.



### Well-Maintained Aircraft

A safe flight starts with a safe airplane. We take great care of our fleet, which includes **Cessna 172s** and the **Beechcraft Duchess**. In aviation, we don't just wait for something to break. We follow a strict schedule of inspections.

Our airplanes go through:
* **Pre-flight inspections:** Every pilot checks the plane before every flight.
* **100-hour inspections:** A deep check of the engine and systems every 100 hours of flight time.
* **Annual inspections:** A complete, detailed review of the entire aircraft once a year.

Our leadership team includes experts like our Chief Pilot, **Paul Janecki**, who has experience as an **Airframe and Powerplant (A&P)** technician. This means we have people in charge who truly understand how airplanes work, inside and out.

### Experienced Instructors

Safety is also about making good decisions. That is why we hire **experienced instructors**. Our team is not just here to build hours; they are here to teach you how to be a professional.

Our team includes **AOPA Flight Training Experience Award** winners who know exactly how to handle the busy airspace of **South Florida**. They teach you to:

* Listen carefully to Air Traffic Control.
* Watch the weather, which can change fast in Florida.
* Make smart choices before you even start the engine.

### Training for Every Situation

Sometimes, safety means being ready for the unexpected. We use technology to help with this. Our **Redbird Flight Simulator** is a powerful tool for safety training.

In the simulator, you can practice emergency procedures that would be too risky to try in a real airplane. You can learn exactly what to do if an engine fails or if the weather gets bad. This builds your "muscle memory" so you react quickly and calmly in real life.

### A Culture of Safety

Safety is not just a set of rules. It is a mindset. At Sun City, we treat every student like family. We want you to enjoy flying, but we also want you to come home safe every day.

From our **[Private Pilot](/professional-pilot-course)** students to those working on their **[Commercial Pilot](/commercial-pilot-training)** certificates, everyone follows the same high standards. We teach you to respect the airplane, the weather, and the regulations.

### Fly with Confidence

When you fly with us in **Pembroke Pines**, you can relax knowing that a whole team is looking out for you. We check the planes, we watch the weather, and we train for every scenario.
