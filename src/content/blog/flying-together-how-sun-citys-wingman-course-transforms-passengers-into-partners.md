_Ever wondered what it's like to truly share the flying experience with your loved ones? At Sun City Aviation Academy, we believe aviation is better when it brings families together._

The roar of the engine, the gentle lift as wheels leave the runway, the breathtaking view from 3,000 feet above South Florida. For many passengers, these moments are simply something to endure or enjoy passively. But what if your spouse, parent, or friend could become an active part of your aviation journey? What if they could share not just the destination, but the entire flying experience?

That's exactly what our Wingman Course delivers. This innovative program transforms nervous passengers into confident flying partners, creating stronger bonds while enhancing safety in the cockpit.

## Beyond the Passenger Seat

Traditional flight training focuses on creating skilled pilots. The Wingman Course takes a different approach by recognizing that many flights involve two people, not just one. When your regular flying companion understands what's happening in the cockpit, magic happens.

Sarah Martinez, whose husband completed his private pilot certificate last year, describes the transformation: "Before the Wingman Course, I'd grip the armrests during every flight. Now I'm checking weather patterns and helping with radio calls. Flying became our shared adventure instead of his solo hobby."

The course isn't about creating pilots (though some participants do catch the flying bug). It's about building competent, confident flying partners who understand their role in the cockpit and can contribute meaningfully to flight safety.

## Real Skills for Real Flights

Our Wingman participants spend time in Sun City's state-of-the-art [Redbird full-motion simulator](https://suncityaviation.com/aircraft-fleet/), experiencing realistic flight scenarios without leaving the ground. The training covers practical skills you'll actually use:

**Communication Mastery**: Learn to handle radio communications with air traffic control, freeing your pilot to focus on flying. Understanding standard phraseology and procedures means you can assist with clearances and position reports.

**Situational Awareness**: Develop the ability to spot other aircraft, identify weather hazards, and monitor critical flight instruments. Two sets of trained eyes are always better than one.

**Emergency Preparedness**: While no one wants to think about emergencies, knowing how to assist during unexpected situations provides invaluable peace of mind. Our training covers everything from basic troubleshooting to how to communicate with emergency services.

**Navigation Support**: Master the fundamentals of reading charts, using GPS systems, and understanding airspace requirements. Many Wingman graduates become expert navigators for their flying families.

## The Family That Flies Together

The Wingman Course creates unique opportunities for family bonding. Take the Johnson family from Coral Springs. When 17-year-old Michael started flight training, his parents felt disconnected from his new passion. After completing the Wingman Course together, they now join him for weekend flights to the Keys.

"We went from being spectators to being crew members," says Michael's mother, Lisa. "Now we plan flights together, check weather as a team, and share the responsibilities. It's brought us closer in ways we never expected."

## Safety Through Partnership

While the bonding aspect is wonderful, the safety benefits are equally compelling. A trained Wingman can:

- Assist with pre-flight inspections and checklists
- Monitor instruments and alert the pilot to changes
- Handle radio communications during busy flight phases
- Provide backup navigation support
- Remain calm and helpful during challenging weather or emergency situations

Chief Flight Instructor Maria Rodriguez notes the difference: "When I see couples who've both completed training programs, the cockpit dynamics are remarkable. They communicate better, work as a team, and create a safer flying environment for everyone."

## Getting Started at Sun City

Our Wingman Course fits busy family schedules with flexible timing options. Most participants complete the program over a weekend, though we also offer weekday sessions and extended formats for those who prefer a more relaxed pace.

The training combines ground instruction with hands-on experience in our [modern aircraft fleet](https://suncityaviation.com/aircraft-fleet/). You'll spend time in our Cessna 172s, learning in the same aircraft your pilot uses for training or leisure flights.

## More Than Just Training

The Wingman Course often serves as a gateway to deeper aviation involvement. About 30% of our Wingman graduates eventually pursue their own pilot certificates. Others become passionate advocates for aviation, joining flying clubs or volunteering at aviation events.

But even those who never touch the controls again benefit enormously. They gain confidence, develop new skills, and most importantly, become true partners in their family's aviation adventures.

## Your Next Step

Whether you're a student pilot wanting to involve your spouse, a parent eager to understand your child's training, or simply someone who wants to be a better flying companion, the Wingman Course offers an ideal introduction to aviation partnership.
