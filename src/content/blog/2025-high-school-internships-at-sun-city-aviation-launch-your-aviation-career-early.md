## Discover the High School Internship Program

Our program gives high school juniors and seniors the opportunity to dive into aviation with a combination of hands-on experiences and guided instruction. It’s a unique chance to step into a professional flight training environment and gain insights that go far beyond the classroom.

### Interns will:

- Shadow FAA-certified flight instructors (CFIs) during live flight operations
- Help with dispatch tasks, flight planning, and aircraft scheduling
- Participate in real-world preflight inspections and learn key safety procedures
- Study aircraft systems including flight controls, engine functions, and avionics
- Join group sessions covering FAA regulations, basic aerodynamics, and weather analysis
- Practice takeoffs, landings, and in-flight maneuvers in our flight simulators
- Collaborate with fellow interns on aviation-based projects and team-building exercises

These structured activities build both technical and soft skills, including communication, attention to detail, critical thinking, and professional conduct.
