**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:**

The City of Pembroke Pines celebrated its 15th Annual Mayor’s Kids Day on June 21, 2024, with a vibrant and fun-filled event themed “Surf’s Up!” Hosted by the new Mayor Angelo Castillo, the event brought joy and excitement to children throughout the city, transforming Pembroke Pines into a playground of surprises, deals, and unforgettable experiences.

The festivities kicked off with a delightful brunch from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM at the Charles F. Dodge City Center, where children had the opportunity to meet Mayor Castillo, interact with celebrity mascots like Cosmo from Bright Star Credit Union and Plato the Publixaurus, and participate in engaging activities.
