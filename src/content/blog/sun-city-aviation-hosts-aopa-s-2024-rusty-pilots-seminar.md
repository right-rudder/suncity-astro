## What to Expect

Led by experienced AOPA Foundation Rusty Pilots Presenter Ted Spitzmiller, the seminar covers:

- Updates on recent changes in aviation regulations and procedures.
- A refresher on fundamental aviation knowledge.
- Insights into current safety practices and airspace regulations.
- Practical advice on navigating the path to becoming current again.

Participants will not only get valuable information but also earn FAA Wings credits and possibly receive an endorsement for a flight review. This is a fantastic chance to reconnect with the aviation community, interact with certified flight instructors, and share experiences with fellow pilots in the greater Miami area.

**NOTE:** A continental-style breakfast will be provided before the seminar and a light lunch will be served at the conclusion; both FREE of charge and while supplies last.

## The Importance of Staying Current

Flying is a skill that benefits greatly from continuous practice and updated knowledge. The aviation landscape evolves with new technologies, regulations, and best practices. This seminar ensures you're up-to-date, confident, and ready to safely command an aircraft once more.
