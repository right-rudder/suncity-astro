If you‚Äôve been looking up at the South Florida sky wondering what it feels like to sit in the left seat, this is your sign. Sun City Aviation Academy in Pembroke Pines helps brand-new students and advancing pilots turn curiosity into confidence‚Äîwith a clear training path, modern aircraft, and a team that treats you like family.

## Start with a Discovery Flight

Your first step is simple: take a Discovery Flight. You‚Äôll sit in the pilot‚Äôs seat with an FAA-certified flight instructor, handle the controls, and get a feel for training from pre-flight briefing to touchdown (the experience runs about an hour and a half). It‚Äôs hands-on, unforgettable, and the perfect way to decide if flying is for you.

After that first flight, Sun City pairs you with a CFI, maps out your next steps, and guides you through the basics‚Äîmedical, ground school, and written prep‚Äîso you‚Äôre ready to solo and, ultimately, ace your checkride.

## A Professional, Step-by-Step Training Path

If you‚Äôre aiming at a career, the Professional Pilot Course bundles the milestones into one streamlined journey‚ÄîPrivate Pilot, Instrument, Commercial, and Multi-Engine‚Äîso you build skill in the right order without losing momentum. Training is supported by a Redbird simulator and Garmin-equipped aircraft, helping you rehearse procedures on the ground and apply them in the air.

### Highlights of the path:

- **Private Pilot (PPL):** where you learn to fly‚Äîand love it.
- **Instrument Rating:** confidence in the system and in the clouds, with simulator time to sharpen procedures.
- **Commercial Pilot (CPL):** precision flying and regs for professional operations.
- **Multi-Engine:** expand capability and employability with multi-engine training and time-building options.

## Train on a Modern Fleet (and a Simulator)

Sun City‚Äôs fleet is tailored to where you are and where you‚Äôre going:
- Dependable Cessna 172s for primary training
- A Beechcraft Duchess for multi-engine operations
- A Cessna 182 Skylane Seaplane for specialty training
- A Redbird simulator to practice procedures, weather, and emergencies efficiently.

## Unique Add-Ons to Boost Your Skills

- **Wingman Course (Passenger Emergency Preparedness):** Give your non-pilot spouse, partner, or frequent passenger the knowledge to communicate with ATC, understand basic controls, and assist if the unexpected happens. It‚Äôs empowering, practical, and genuinely reassuring for everyone who rides along.
- **Seaplane Safari (SES training):** Experience the thrill of freshwater takeoffs and landings while expanding your stick-and-rudder skills in a new environment.
- **Youth Programs:** Inspire the next generation through Experience Aviation and Aviation 101.

## Why South Florida‚Äîand Why Sun City

Training at Sun City means busy, diverse airspace, lots of real-world radio time, and a supportive team that keeps you progressing. The academy is based in Pembroke Pines and serves the greater Miami area, making it convenient whether you‚Äôre local or relocating to train.
